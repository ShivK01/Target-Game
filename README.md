# Target-Game
This is a interactive target shooting game I created in processing combining skills I learned in about array lists, arrays, and images, and PVectors in Processing.

To play the game, you will have twenty shots displayed on screen. A target will randomely appear somewhere on screen and you can use the up/down keys to change cannon power and right/left keys to change cannon angle. Once you are ready to fire, press the space bar and a cannonball will launch!

If the  target is hit, it will "explode" through a short animation sequence and a new target will appear. If not hit, the target will remain. Additionaly, if the cannonball htis the ground somewhere in frame, the will be a smoke animation at the impact point created through the use of a particle system.

After all balls have been fired, a ranking will appear based on how many targets you hit and an option to play again will be prompted.

# Code Challenges
The more difficult aspects of designing this came revolved around the animations. I used images loaded in from a folder to serve as the cannonball, cannon, background, and target. So, it was a challenge to figure out when to display certain animations. However, through this project, I was able to demonstrate my understanding of PVectors through the addition of gravity on the cannonball, as well as my understanding of image arrays through the cannonball and target animations. I also got to include knowledge about particle systems in the smoke animation and user input throgh the game control.
